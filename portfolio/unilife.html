                    <h2>Volunteering</h2>
                    <p>The first thing that got me involved was volunteering. After graduating high school and entering university, some of my group mates joined this association. 
                        Since I love being around people, enjoy organizing events, and like being active in the university's social life, it was a perfect opportunity for me.

                        I participated in three events organized by this association, and I really enjoyed it. The first event was a Career Fair. 
                        There, I learned the basics of how to interact with people, what this association actually does, 
                        and how to present myself in public while representing the university. 
                        I also became familiar with the requirements for getting a job through the Career Fair.
                        
                        But the most memorable event was the Navruz Party, because before that, I had never taken part in setting up or helping to organize such a large-scale event. 
                        I was happy to be involved because I gained a lot of valuable experience, and it felt great to be an essential part of the university community. 
                        It was also rewarding to contribute to the future, as this association provides certificates and other benefits for participating in events.</p>

                    <h2>My Group-mates</h2>
                    <p>So, what can I say about my group mates? After realizing I had graduated from high school, I was a bit worried about making new friends.

                        In school, my classmates weren't just people I studied with for 11 years — they became my second family, people who felt like home to me. 
                        I was afraid I wouldn’t find new friends in a completely new place, somewhere I had never been before. That fear was strong in the beginning.
                        
                        But fortunately, my first group at university turned out to be really nice.
                         I got along well with them, and I’m still in touch with some of them, especially since we study in the same field.
                        
                        However, the best part for me came with my second group, after finishing my first year.
                         That’s where I found close friends — people with shared goals and values. 
                         They became just as dear to me as my old classmates.
                        
                        My current group brings me so much joy. 
                        We not only study the same subject, but we also share the same goals.
                         We even organize trips together to relax and get to know other students from the IT department. 
                         I’m really glad I stuck with my chosen field and didn’t give in to the pressure to switch directions.
                        
                        I truly enjoy what I study, I love my group, and I’m grateful for the friends I’ve made and the people I get to learn with every day.
