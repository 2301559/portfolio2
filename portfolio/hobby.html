                    <h2>Gym</h2>
                    <p>I discovered my passion for the gym a few years ago, during a very challenging period in my life. At that time, I was desperately searching for something that could take my mind off the difficulties surrounding me — a space that could offer me peace and purpose. Looking back now, I realize that stepping into the gym was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.

                        The gym has become more than just a physical space for me; it’s a place where I can disconnect from the outside world, clear my mind, and recharge emotionally. It helps me stay motivated, focused, and grounded. Through regular training, I’ve come to understand the value of discipline — a quality that’s essential for growth but incredibly hard to build and maintain.
                        
                        To be honest, the gym has become an integral part of my life. It’s not just about fitness; it’s about mental strength, self-discovery, and resilience.</p>

                    <h2>Make up</h2>
                    <p>I became interested in the beauty industry after finishing high school. It all started when I began drawing simple eyeliner wings on my eyes — mostly out of boredom. Over time, I gradually started adding more to my makeup routine. When I entered university, I became more self-aware and made a conscious decision to find the makeup style that best suited my face shape.

                        By experimenting with different techniques and styles, I was able to discover what truly worked for me — and I did it without forcing anything. Now, makeup has become a form of self-expression and even a kind of therapy for me. Every morning, as I spend time in front of the mirror, I genuinely enjoy the process. It helps me feel calm, confident, and ready to face the day.

                    <h2>Cooking</h2>
                    <p>I started cooking relatively recently, in the fall of 2024. At first, it was simply a way to fill my free time, but as I grew older, a sense of responsibility naturally followed. What initially drew me in was working with dough — I found joy in doing something with my hands, in the physical process of creating something from scratch.

                        What I love most about cooking is that it’s both creative and rewarding. You invest your time, effort, and care into a dish, and in return, you get to enjoy it and share it with others. There’s something truly satisfying about being able to prepare food that not only tastes good but also brings joy to your family and loved ones.
                        
                        For me, cooking is one of my love languages. The people I cook for are the ones I truly care about. Through food, I express warmth, affection, and appreciation. Being able to nourish and delight the people I value makes the process even more meaningful.</p>
